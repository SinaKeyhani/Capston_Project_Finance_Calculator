# Capstone Project - Finance Calculator 
Welcome to my Capstone Project repository! In this project, I have developed a comprehensive financial calculator program tailored for a small financial company. The primary objective of this program is to provide users with convenient access to two essential financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

The investment calculator within this program empowers users to make informed financial decisions by accurately estimating the future value of their investments. With customizable parameters such as initial investment amount, interest rate, and investment period, users can explore various investment scenarios and visualize potential returns.

In addition to the investment calculator, this program features a robust home loan repayment calculator. This calculator is designed to assist users in understanding their home loan repayment obligations more effectively. By inputting parameters such as loan amount, interest rate, and loan term, users can obtain detailed repayment schedules and insights into their mortgage commitments.

Whether users are planning their financial future through investments or managing their mortgage repayments, this financial calculator program offers intuitive tools to support informed decision-making. With user-friendly interfaces and accurate calculations, users can navigate complex financial scenarios with confidence.
